        <ol>
          <li>Rinse rib pieces under cold water and place in a large pot. Fill with water and add ginger. Place pot over high heat and boil for 30 minutes, skimming the fat from the surface as it forms. </li>
          <li>Drain and rinse rib pieces in cold water for a second time, removing any excess fat, debris and ginger.</li>
          <li>Place a large Dutch oven, or heavy bottom pot over medium-high heat and add oil. Add ribs and season with salt and pepper. Brown for about 3 minutes. Add remaining ingredients to the pot and stir together.</li>
          <li>Bring mixture to a boil then reduce heat to medium-low. Cover.</li> 
          <li>Simmer mixture for 45 minutes to an hour, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender.</li>
          <li>Scoop 2/3 cup of the sauce into a small pot (skimming off any excess fat) and stir in honey. Simmer for 15 to 20 minutes or until mixture has reduced by 1/3. Remove from heat and allow to cool for about 15 minutes.</li>
          <li>Brush glaze over rib pieces and serve over white or brown rice. Top with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Serve.</li>
