          <li>1 large, round loaf of uncut sourdough bread </li>
          <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) cold salted butter, cut into 16 slices </li>
          <li>1 cup shredded white cheddar cheese</li>
          <li>1 cup shredded gouda</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon minced rosemary</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon minced sage</li>
          <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
          <li>1/4 cup pomegranate seeds</li>

          <li>Aluminum Foil</li>
        </ul> 

      <div class="recipeimage header-pullapartbread2" alt="pull apart bread"></div>
      <h3>Directions</h3>
      
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375˚F. </li>
          <li>Line a baking sheet with Aluminum Foil and lightly coat with cooking spray. Set aside.</li>
          <li>With a serrated knife, make diagonal cuts through the loaf of bread in opposite directions (leaving the bottom crust intact), so you have 1-inch pieces exposed all over the bread.</li>
          <li>Place loaf onto the foil-lined baking sheet and insert pats of butter in the slits throughout the loaf.</li> 
          <li>Add the remaining ingredients together in a mixing bowl and toss together until well combined.</li>
          <li>Stuff the cheese mixture evenly throughout the slits in the loaf until all of the mixture has been used and the entire loaf is filled.</li>
          <li>Place the loaf in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Transfer loaf to the broiler and broil for about 1 minute for an extra-toasted top.</li>
          <li>Remove and allow the bread to sit for 5–7 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
