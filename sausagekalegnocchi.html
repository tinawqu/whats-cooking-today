        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 375°F. </li>
          <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add a small handful of salt (about 3 tablespoons) and add the gnocchi.</li>
          <li>Once the gnocchi float to the surface remove from the pot and transfer to a large platter. Set aside.</li>
          <li>In a large skillet, add 2 tablespoons oil and place over medium-high heat. Add sausage and brown for 3 to 4 minutes, breaking up into bite-sized pieces.</li>
          <li>Add kale and continue to sauté for an additional 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer mixture into a mixing bowl and set aside.</li>
          <li>Pour remaining oil into the skillet and add gnocchi to the pan. Lightly brown for 2 to 3 minutes and then transfer gnocchi into the same bowl as the sausage and kale.</li>
          <li>Add shallots, garlic and cream into the skillet and simmer over medium heat. Once the mixture has reduced by 1/3 add the Parmesan and stir. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
          <li>Add the gnocchi mixture and continue to simmer over low heat for 1 minute. Transfer mixture to a shallow baking dish and bake for 15 to 20 minutes or until mixture has thickened.</li>
          <li>Remove from heat, top with crushed pepper flakes and serve.</li>
